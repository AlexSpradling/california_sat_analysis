# A Comparative Analysis of Standardized Test Results Between CA School Districts
--- 
### College-Readiness Benchmarks as a Barometer of Access and College Preparation
---
## Problem Statement

*The Mayor would like to "move the needle on education". Our firm has been brought in to make recommendations on the best course of action. We will endeavor to use SAT/ACT enrollment and benchmark performance between California school districts in 2018-2019 in order to analyze district-level causal factors for over and under performance, with the goal of recommending the most effective and equitable course of action to the town education board.*

## Summary

A broad-spectrum analysis of SAT/ACT performance by California School district is undertaken, using the percent of students scoring at or above the SAT and ACT college-readiness benchmark scores as the primary metric. This report attempts to explain college-readiness benchmark under and overperformance at the school district level through the analysis of enrollment metrics, teacher demographic metrics-such as overall level of teacher education, student-to-teacher ratio and years teaching, as well as school district fiscal data.
